## Setup Instructions

### Phase 1: Prepare Google Spreadsheet

#### 1-1. Create a New Spreadsheet
1. Open [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/)
2. Create a new spreadsheet from "Blank"
3. Rename it to something like "Receipt Manager"

#### 1-2. Get Spreadsheet ID
- Get from URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/【This is the Spreadsheet ID】/edit`
- Note down this **Spreadsheet ID** (will be used later)

---

### Phase 2: Deploy Google Apps Script

#### 2-1. Open Apps Script Editor
1. In the spreadsheet top menu → "Extensions" → "Apps Script"
2. Apps Script editor opens in a new tab

#### 2-2. Paste the Code
1. Delete the default `function myFunction() {}`
2. Copy all contents of `gas/receipt_processor.gs`
3. Paste into the Apps Script editor

#### 2-3. Set Spreadsheet ID
```javascript
const SPREADSHEET_ID = 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE';  // ← Replace with actual ID
```

**Example:**
```javascript

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Error talking to connector" or "Failed Outbound Call"

**This is a GPTs Actions connection error. Check the following in order:**

**Cause 1: Apps Script Version Update**
After updating the script, always deploy with a new version:
1. "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
2. Pencil icon → "Version" → "New version"
3. Click "Deploy"

**Cause 2: Actions Schema Issue**
- Confirm you're using `gpts/actions_schema.json`
- Check that `operationId` is set to `addReceipt`

**Cause 3: Server URL Setting Error**
- Confirm the URL ends with `/exec`
  - ✅ Correct: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx.../exec`
  - ❌ Wrong: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx...`
- Check that the `"paths"` section is `"/"` (not `"/exec"`)

**Cause 4: Authentication Setting**
- Confirm Authentication is set to "None"
- Check that no API Key is set

**Cause 5: Apps Script Access Permissions**
- Apps Script → "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
- Confirm "Who has access" is set to **"Anyone"** (this is most important!)

**Debug Method:**
1. Test directly from terminal:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://script.google.com/macros/s/【Your ID】/exec" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"store":"Test","total":1000}'
```
2. If no error → GAS side is normal → Review GPTs Actions settings
3. If error occurs → Check GAS deployment settings

---

### Error: "API call failed"

**Cause 1: Deployment URL is wrong**
- Check `servers.url` in `gpts/actions_schema.json`
- Re-confirm the correct URL from "Manage deployments" in Apps Script

**Cause 2: No execution permission for Apps Script**
- Run `testAddReceipt` in Apps Script editor to re-authorize

**Cause 3: Access permission is not "Anyone"**
- Apps Script → "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
- Click pencil icon → Change "Who has access" to "Anyone"

### Error: "Spreadsheet not found"

**Cause: SPREADSHEET_ID is wrong**
- Check `SPREADSHEET_ID` in `receipt_processor.gs`
- Copy correct ID from spreadsheet URL

### Receipt image is not read correctly

**Solution:**
- Take the photo in a bright location
- Ensure entire receipt fits in frame
- Avoid blurry photos
- Avoid shadows

### GPTs doesn't extract "item details"

**Solution:**
- Explicitly instruct "Please also extract item details"
- Confirm receipt image is clear
- Check that item section is not cut off

---

## Customization Methods

### Add or Change Categories

**Edit instructions.md:**
```markdown
- Infer category from store name or item content
  - Convenience stores, supermarkets → Food
  - Drugstores → Daily Goods
  - Transportation-related → Transportation
  - Leisure facilities → Entertainment
  - Bookstores → Books        ← Added
  - Clothing stores → Clothing    ← Added
```

Update GPTs "Configure" → "Instructions"

### Add Columns to Spreadsheet

**Edit receipt_processor.gs:**

1. Add items to the `row` array in `addReceiptToSheet` function:
```javascript
const row = [
  timestamp,
  data.date || '',
  data.store || '',
  data.category || '',
  data.total || 0,
  data.tax || 0,
  data.paymentMethod || '',
  data.location || '',              // ← New: Store location
  JSON.stringify(data.items || []),
  data.notes || ''
];
```

2. Update headers in `createReceiptSheet` function:
```javascript
const headers = [
  '登録日時',
  '購入日',
  '店舗名',
  'カテゴリ',
  '合計金額',
  '消費税',
  '支払方法',
  '店舗所在地',    // ← Added
  '商品明細',
  'メモ'
];
```

3. In Apps Script, "Deploy" → "New deployment" to upgrade version

4. Also add the field to instructions.md and actions_schema.json

---

## Security Considerations

### Important Points
1. **Personal Information**: Receipts may contain personal information
2. **Access Control**: Properly manage spreadsheet sharing settings
3. **GPTs Publishing Scope**: "Only me" recommended (or "Anyone with a link" for family sharing)

### Recommended Settings
- Spreadsheet: Accessible only by yourself
- GPTs: Only me (yourself only)
- Apps Script: Access permission must be "Anyone" (required to function as API)

---

## Operational Tips

### Regular Maintenance
- Back up spreadsheet data about once a month
- Periodically move unnecessary receipt data to archive sheet

### Efficient Usage
1. **Continuous Shooting**: Take multiple receipts at once then process in batch
2. **Category Correction**: Register first, then correct categories in batch
3. **Monthly Summary**: Monthly analysis with spreadsheet pivot table feature

### Data Analysis Utilization
The following analyses are possible in spreadsheet:
- Category-based spending graph
- Store usage frequency
- Monthly spending trend
- Total consumption tax

**Example: Creating a Pivot Table**
1. Select data range
2. "Insert" → "Pivot table"
3. Row: Category, Value: Sum of total amount
